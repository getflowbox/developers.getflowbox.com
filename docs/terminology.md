### Content
Content is a singular item, such as (but not limited to):
  * Instagram Post
  * Facebook Post
  * Pintrest pin

### Flow
A Flow is a collection of Content, usually Curated and with added Metadata.

### Flow key
The Flow key is a unique key that identifies a Flow in the Flowbox platform. It's used as an identifier for a specific Flow and is used when embedding the Flowbox widget on a site.

The easiest way to find this is by copying it from the "Copy Flow Key" option in the meatball (three-dot) menu in Moderate in Flowbox:

### Json
Json or JavaScript Object Notation is a structured approach to data management. Similar to XML but much simpler and easier to read. JSON is the default serialization format  within the Flowbox system. JSON have a limited set of types and close attention needs to be paid to the correct JSON-type for metadata when interacting with the API.

### Metadata
is data about data or information about data. Originally, the concept of meta-information, ie information about information. Normally metadata describes the content and / or structure for a given data collection from any perspective.
